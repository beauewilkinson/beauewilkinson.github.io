    <h1>Tashirojima!</h1>
    <p>
      Tashirojima is a small island in Ishinomaki Bay. You may hear of it being referred to as "Cat Island", and it lives up to this name--the population of cats outnumbers the population of humans. <br><br>
      The reason the cat population is so high has to do with the island's history: Tashirojima was originally abundant with silk production in the Edo period, and farmers would keep cats to fend off the mice that ate silkworm pods. Due to a decree in 1602 that freed all pet cats to fight these rodent populations, the pet cats of Tashirojima became free and spread like wildfire across the island. <br><br>
      There is a cat shrine near the center of the island where inhabitants and tourists alike can leave offerings for good luck. The shrine was constructed in honor of one cat who passed due to a falling rock, and so the shrine is adorned with cat toys, maneki-neko, and prayers. <br><br>
      There are many attractions on the island, besides the numerous cats you'll encounter. Manga Island, located on the southern tip of the island, is an outdoor recreational area consisting of striped cat-shaped bungalows for rent, which come equipped with showers and cooking equipment. There is also much space for picnicking, camping, and taking in the ocean view. The cats are used to people on Manga Island and will most likely come looking for food. <br><br>
      The island is great for an overnight stay due to its distance from the mainland, resulting in dark and clear skies for stargazing. Day trips are also common, it is simply asked that anyone traveling through the island take all of their trash with them.
